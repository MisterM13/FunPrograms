# Advent Calendar 

This is a little Project I made for Christmas, to share joy and fun with programming. Lets get Christmas. 


## Usage:

### For Mac users:
Just open the `AdventCaledar` app. The rest should work by itself. Please make shure, that the path to this Directory has no spaces in it. (No directories with two or more separated names)

### For all others:
Run the AdventCalendar.java direct from console:

```bash 
javac AdventCalendar.java
java AdventCalendar
```
## Notes:
If it's not advent, the program only prints a black Christmas tree. The Program automatically knows which day of advent it is.
To run the Advent Calendar java is needed. You can download it [here.](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)

Languages used:
- java 
- bash

Tested under macOS Catalina (10.15.4), jdk 13.0.1
