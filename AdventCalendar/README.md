# Advent Calendar 

This is a little Project I made for Christmas, to share joy and fun with programming. Lets get Christmas. 


## Usage:

### For Mac users:
Just click on the `AdventCaledar` app. (With the tree Icon) The rest should work by itself. Pleas make shure, that the path to this Directory has no spaces in it. (No directories with two or more separated names)

### For all others:
Run the AdventCalendar.java direct from console:

```bash 
javac AdventCalendar.java
java AdventCalendar
```
## Notes:
If it's not advent, the program only prints a black Christmas tree. The Program automatically knows which day of advent it is.

Languages used:
: java 
: bash

Tested under macOS Catalina (10.15.4), jdk 13.0.1
